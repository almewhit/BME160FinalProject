Tracking the Mother-Pup Relationships of Northern Elephant Seals

Abstract:
This project centers around long term research conducted on Northern elephant seals in Northern California. Studying individual adult females and pup behavior during the breeding season (December - February) presents challenges due to the unpredictable and dynamic nature of fieldwork within the elephant seal colony. Therefore, the project aims to address the challenge of studying adult female behavior by providing tools to analyze current and future female-pup relationships. Our program provides tools to visualize a target individualâ€™s breeding season behavior in relation to the larger population, while also providing pupping date predictions for the future breeding season. These tools give researchers the ability to more effectively study target individuals during fieldwork, and have potential to contribute to long-term conservation and population management efforts.
